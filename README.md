# chromium-launcher

A simple Chromium launcher with support for Pepper Flash.

## Requirements

* The main `chromium-launcher` script needs `Perl 5.13.9` (or later) and the
  `File::BaseDir` module.
* The tiny `launcher-errmsg` program used for error message display needs
  `gtk+-2.0`.

## Usage

This launcher was originally written for the Arch Linux Chromium package.

It is meant to be installed as `/usr/bin/chromium` and act as a wrapper around
the Chromium binary.
